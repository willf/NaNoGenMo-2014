Day one.
It is morning. The whole company is assembled, in a wide circle around Treebeard.
The Ents began to murmur slowly, all chanting together.
Treebeard tells the Entmoot the names of Pippen and Merry. The Entmoot agrees they are not Orcs. A new line is put into the old lists.
Treebeard pauses to talk to Pippen and Merry. They bow, to the amusement of the Ents. The Ents return to their business. Late morning.
Treebeard pauses to introduce Bregalad/Quickbeam. They walk with him all day. At night, he brings them to his ent-house.

Day two. 
Merry and Pippen stay near Quickbeam's house. The day is colder. 

Day three.
At sunrise, "the Ents' voices rose to a great clamour and then died down again."
In the afternoon, everything is "very quiet." Then "ra-hoom-rah!" and the Ents begin their march.
